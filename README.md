# Solution4: Minimum Number of Moves to Make Palindrome
Let’s solve the Minimum Number of Moves to Make Palindrome problem using the Two Pointers pattern.

## Statement
Given a string s, return the minimum number of moves required to transform s into a palindrome. In each move, you can swap any two adjacent characters in s.

# Solution5: Next Palindrome Using Same Digits
Let’s solve the Next Palindrome Using Same Digits problem using the Two Pointers pattern.

## Statement
Given a string num_str representing a palindrome, the string only contains digits. Your task is to return the next possible palindrome using the same digits. The returned palindrome would be the next largest palindrome, meaning there can be more than one way to rearrange the digits to make a larger palindrome. Return an empty string if no greater palindrome can be made.
